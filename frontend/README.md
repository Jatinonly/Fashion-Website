# Nocturne — clothing e-commerce frontend

A responsive storefront (360px → desktop) built with **Vite + React 19 (JavaScript)**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, **Zustand** and **React Router**. The visual direction follows an editorial fashion layout: a neon announcement bar, edge-to-edge product grids with hairline separators, oversized neon category banners, and a sticky product-detail panel.

Data comes from the Express + Postgres API in `../backend` when `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is set, or from in-browser mock services when it's empty. See the root `README.md` for full setup.

---

## Getting started

Run commands from the **repo root** (npm workspaces): `npm install`, then `npm run dev` starts the API and this app together. To run only the frontend: `npm run dev:web`.

```bash
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env   # VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api uses the backend; empty = mocks
```

The scripts below also work inside `frontend/` (`npm run <script> -w frontend` from the root).

| Script                 | What it does                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `npm run dev`          | Start the Vite dev server            |
| `npm run build`        | Production build (`vite build`)      |
| `npm run preview`      | Serve the production build           |
| `npm run lint`         | ESLint (React Hooks + Refresh)       |
| `npm run format`       | Prettier (with Tailwind class order) |
| `npm run format:check` | Check formatting without writing     |

**Demo login:** `demo@nocturne.in` / `password123` (or sign up with any email; accounts are stored in localStorage).

```

**State persistence:** `cart`, `wishlist`, `auth` (user + token only) and `orders` persist to localStorage via Zustand's `persist` middleware, under the keys `nocturne:*`. Filters and UI state are not persisted.

---

## Changing the theme

All colours, fonts, radii, shadows and animations are design tokens in **`src/index.css`** inside `@theme { … }`.

The default Tailwind palette is turned off (`--color-*: initial`), so components can only use token classes such as `bg-surface`, `text-ink`, `bg-accent`, `border-line` and `text-sale`. Change a value once and the whole UI follows:

```css
@theme {
  --color-accent: #3cff00; /* signature neon → try #ff4d00 */
  --color-surface: #ebebeb; /* product tile background */
  --font-sans: 'Inter Tight', …;
  --font-display: 'Italiana', …; /* section headings, newsletter */
  --radius-sm: 3px;
}
```

Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts in `index.html`. Update that `<link>` if you change families.

**Brand content** (name, logo text, announcements, nav links, footer columns, legal links, support details, free-shipping threshold) lives in **`src/config/site.js`**.

---

## Replacing images

Every image goes through **`src/lib/images.js`**:

- `getProductImages(ref)` / `getProductImage(ref, view)`: product images. These currently return generated SVG garment silhouettes in the product's colour.
- `bannerImage(key, w, h)`: hero, category and editorial images. These currently come from `picsum.photos` with stable seeds.

To use real photography, change only those functions. For example:

```js
export function getProductImages(ref) {
  return ['front', 'back', 'detail'].map((view) => ({
    src: `https://cdn.example.com/products/${ref.id}/${slug(ref.colourHex)}/${view}.jpg`,
    alt: `${ref.name} — ${view}`,
  }))
}
```

If your API returns `product.images`, add that field to the `Product` typedef (in `productService.js`), then return it here.

---

## Mock services vs the real backend

Components and stores never touch `src/data/*` directly. They only call `src/services/*`.

Each service checks `env.useMockApi` (true when `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is empty). In API mode it calls the backend through `apiRequest` in `services/http.js`, which attaches the logged-in user's token automatically and logs the user out if the API rejects it (401). Function signatures and return shapes are identical in both modes, so components don't care which one is active.

| Service        | Endpoints (backend/src/routes)                                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| productService | `GET /products`, `GET /products/:slug`, `GET /products/:id/related`, `GET /products/search` |
| authService    | `POST /auth/login`, `POST /auth/signup`, `POST /auth/logout`                                |
| orderService   | `POST /orders`, `GET /orders`, `GET /orders/:id`                                            |
| paymentService | `POST /payments/razorpay/order`, `POST /payments/razorpay/verify`, `POST /payments/razorpay/fail` |

The backend re-prices the cart and checks stock when creating an order; totals sent by the client are ignored.

`src/data/products.js` is also the source for `npm run db:seed`. Once products are managed in the database, the mock branches and that file can be deleted.

---

## Enabling real Razorpay

With a non-empty `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, the backend controls which checkout is used. Set `RAZORPAY_MOCK=true` in `backend/.env` to use the simulated popup while still testing API order creation and stock reservation; no Razorpay keys are needed in this mode. Set `RAZORPAY_MOCK=false` and configure `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`, and `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `backend/.env` for real Razorpay test-mode checkout. The key secret and webhook secret must never be placed in frontend environment variables. Restart the backend after changing these values.

Checkout first creates a pending order through `POST /orders`, which prices the cart and reserves stock. It then sends only that database order id to `POST /payments/razorpay/order`; the backend creates the gateway order from its stored total and returns its key id. After checkout, the frontend sends the signature and both Razorpay ids to `POST /payments/razorpay/verify`. A failed or dismissed checkout is reported to `POST /payments/razorpay/fail`, which marks the order cancelled and restores stock.

Configure the Razorpay webhook URL as `/api/payments/razorpay/webhook` and subscribe to `payment.captured` and `order.paid`. The webhook signature is verified against the exact raw request body so an order is still marked paid if the customer closes the page before verification completes.

Cash on delivery continues to create an order with payment pending and order status placed. No `RAZORPAY_MOCK` variable is needed in `frontend/.env`: the backend includes a mock flag in its payment-order response, and the frontend uses it to choose the simulated popup. Mock checkout also remains available when `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is empty.

## TODO / next steps

- Replace placeholder images in `lib/images.js`.
- Auth: token refresh, password reset and login rate limiting. (The backend hashes passwords with bcrypt; the mock stores plain passwords in localStorage and is for UI work only.)
- Restock on order cancellation.
- Saved addresses, coupons, order cancellation/returns, reviews, and the newsletter API.
- CMS content for the placeholder info pages (`/help/*`, `/legal/*`, `/about`, `/stores`).
- Tests (Vitest + Testing Library, Playwright for the checkout flow).
